# Maname Fonts Project
Maname is a typeface family for publishing text in many languages.


## Current stable version
There is no stable release of the font yet :( You can contribute to get the stable builds out soon, I will publish how to soon :)

## Development preview

This section presents a preview of fonts in active development in the `dev` branch. Images are built from the sources on a daily basis, so things are bound to be broken, ugly and imperfect :)
