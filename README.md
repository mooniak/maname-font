This project was orignally conceptualised and prototyped by Pathum Egodawatta as a superfamily with many styles and scripts in partial fulfilment for the requirements for the Master of Arts in Typeface Design (MATD) at the University of Reading, Department of Typography and Graphic Communication in 2016. Since then a selected Latin and Sinhala componats from the academic project were extended to include support for wider Latin charachter set and full Sinhala support under the name Maname.
